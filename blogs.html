        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Marginalisation and social division prevent communities from living in peace. We believe that people are best-placed for identifying and addressing their own security concerns. Our approach brings people together for peace – they define what security is, who it is for and how it is delivered in their communities. 
            Our work
            Too often, security services and ‘solutions’ are disconnected from the needs of the people they are meant to help. Saferworld works with communities to ensure that people take the lead in developing their own security solutions together with relevant authorities. We connect communities, local leaders (for example, religious 
             leaders, clan leaders and elders), the media, informal security providers, police, authorities and government officials to find joint solutions. Often with opposing views, these groups work through conflict, overcome divisions, and build better relations between communities and authorities.

        <h4 style="color: blue;">The Importance of Cyber Security Awareness</h4>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Cyber security awareness is the combination of both knowing and doing something to protect a business’s information assets. When an enterprise’s employees are cyber security aware, it means they understand what cyber threats are, the potential impact a cyber-attack will have on their business and the steps required to reduce risk and prevent cyber-crime infiltrating their online workspace.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Creating a culture around cyber security awareness in the workplace doesn’t mean that you’ll be completely eradicating the risk of data theft or cyber-crime to your business. Malware has burgeoned, becoming more and more sophisticated as each new strand is developed, and we expect to see the evolution and growth of cyber-threats and malware to proliferate. It was reported that 123 new strains of malware were found everyday in 2005[3]. During that year, 10,000 of those threats were new strains of malware. 11 years later, research had shown that every second, four new strains of malicious malware were discovered in Q3 of 2016[4] - it’s crucial to highlight that these were the strains that cyber security companies had found and identified. As new strains of malware grow, enterprises need to ensure that they’re implementing the appropriate security measures, educating their employees and eliminating any weaknesses that make them vulnerable to an attack. Human error is an egregious exploit that can lead to fines and severe business damage.

        <h4 style="color: blue;">Child Cyberbullying: What Is It and How To Stop It</h4>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Cyberbullying is bullying with the use of digital technologies. It can take place on social media, messaging platforms, gaming platforms and mobile phones. It is repeated behaviour, aimed at scaring, angering or shaming those who are targeted. Examples include:
            <ol>
            <li>spreading lies about or posting embarrassing photos of someone on social media</li>
            <li>sending hurtful messages or threats via messaging platforms</li>
            <li>impersonating someone and sending mean messages to others on their behalf.</li> 
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Face-to-face bullying and cyberbullying can often happen alongside each other. But cyberbullying leaves a digital footprint – a record that can prove useful and provide evidence to help stop the abuse.
            All friends joke around with each other, but sometimes it’s hard to tell if someone is just having fun or trying to hurt you, especially online. Sometimes they’ll laugh it off with a “just kidding,” or “don’t take it so seriously.”

        <h4 style="color: blue;">Crime Prevention</h4>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Crime prevention is the attempt to reduce and determine crime and criminals. It is applied specifically to efforts made by governments to reduce crime, enforce the law, and maintain criminal justice.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Criminologists, commissions, and research bodies such as the World Health Organization, United Nations, the United States National Research Council, the UK Audit Commission have analyzed their and others' research on what lowers rates of interpersonal crime.
            They agree that governments must go beyond law enforcement and criminal justice to tackle the risk factors that cause crime because it is more cost effective and leads to greater social benefits than the standard ways of responding to crime. Multiple opinion 
            polls also confirm public support for investment in prevention. Waller uses these materials in Less Law, More Order to propose specific measures to reduce crime as well as a crime bill.
            The commissions agree on the role of municipalities, because they are best able to organize the strategies to tackle the risk factors that cause crime. The European Forum for Urban Safety and the United States Conference of Mayors have stressed that municipalities must target the programs to meet the needs of youth at risk and women who are vulnerable to violence.[citation needed]
            To succeed, they need to establish a coalition of key agencies such as schools, job creation, social services, housing and law enforcement around a diagnosis.

        <h4 style="color: blue;">Criminal Psychology</h4>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Criminal psychology, also referred to as criminological psychology, is the study of the views, thoughts, intentions, actions and reactions of criminals and all who participate in criminal behavior
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Psychologists are licensed professionals that can assess both mental and physical states. Profilers look for patterns in behavior to link the individual(s) behind a crime. A group effort attempts to answer the most common psychological questions: If there is a risk of a sexual predator re-offending if put back in society; if an offender is competent to stand trial; whether or not an offender was sane/insane at the time of the offense.
            Criminal psychologists can be used to do investigative work, like examine photographs of a crime, or conduct an interview with a suspect. They sometimes have to formulate a hypothesis, in order to assess what an offender is going to do next, after they have broken the law.
            The question of competency to stand trial is a question of an offender's current state of mind. This assesses the offender's ability to understand the charges against them, the possible outcomes of being convicted/acquitted of these charges and their ability to assist their attorney with their defense. The question of sanity/insanity or criminal responsibility is an assessment of the offender's state of mind at the time of the crime. This refers to their ability to understand right from wrong and what is against the law. The insanity defense is rarely used, as it is very difficult to prove. If declared insane, an offender is committed to a secure hospital facility for much longer than they would have served in prison.
            Criminal psychology is also related to legal psychology and forensic psychology. and crime investigations
            A major part of criminal psychology, known as criminal profiling, began in the 1940s. The United States Office of Strategic Services asked William L. Langer's brother Walter C.
